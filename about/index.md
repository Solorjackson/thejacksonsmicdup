My name is Rocky Jackson and my partners name is Titus Jackson. I was inspired to start this podcast and website for coding class and we realized that we really enjoy recording about NFL and NBA topics. It does not really matter to us if we get a lot of listens or not, we have a great time recording the episodes and posting them online. We are teenagers from Tennessee who played lacrosse and basketball throughout High School; however, we are most interested in NFL/NBA statistics and analysis. We put our around 4 podcasts per week (2 NBA & 2 NFL).
