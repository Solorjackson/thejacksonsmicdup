title: Episode 11
description: Today Titus, Grant, and I spoke about different teams in the NBA that are having different starts to the season than originally predicted. We were talking about if we should overreact or not to these teams having odd starts to the season. For example, we talked about how the Pacers are having a tough start compared to what people thought they were going to be doing. In Grant & Titus's opinion was that the Pacers would continue to struggle (so he is "Overreacting") and I think the Pacers will pick it up a little (so I am "Not Overreacting"). We will be doing one of these types of episodes once every 2 weeks intertwining with our current league review for the NBA. We had Grant on here for the first time (of many most likely). Bulls Championship bound?
