description: Today we had a guest speaker! We had our friend Mason Hoyle on to talk about the crazy week that was week 9. Throughout this week, the jags beat the bills, the broncos beat the cowboys, the titans beat the rams, etc. My super bowl prediction was bills v rams, so this was quite the surprising week. (As a jags fan, It was quite the awesome week too). Josh Allen LB > Josh Allen QB?
