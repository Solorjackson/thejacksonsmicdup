title: Episode 7
description: Today Titus and I discussed the crazy state that the NBA is in right now. For example the Bulls, Cavs, Wizards, Bucks, etc. are all very big surprises so far this season. Some teams that were projected (by us too) as lower tier teams, are playing exceptional this season, whereas, some top tier projected teams are playing like mid-low tier teams so far this season. We will have to see throughout the season if this continues to happen. Our format will be to flip flop between current NBA talks and a ranking of some sort (with the NBA podcasts). The same type of process will happen with our NFL side of things (we will do a QB ranking to start off coming out November 17th, 2021).
