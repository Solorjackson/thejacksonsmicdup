description: Today Titus and I did a ranking (1-32) of the top 2 running backs for each team. This was a hard list to format because some teams have one really good running back and then a not so good backup running back (for ex. steelers). This is an interesting list because it is not just running back game for each team, it is more formatted half way from all statistics on these running backs and half way from the talent of each running back.
