title: Episode 9
description: Today Titus and I did a ranking of all the starting Shooting Guards in the league. This is the 2nd episode of our "ranking NBA positions" series. We did a PG tier list that was pretty controversial, and this one is similar in that aspect. We did not talk about our rankings before the podcast, so these are our raw reactions to each others positioning of each starting Shooting Guard around the league.
