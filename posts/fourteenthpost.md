description: Today Titus and I reviewed our picks from last week and then previewed week 12. My record for this week was 9-6 and Titus's Record for this week was 7-8. This brings our total records to 16-12-1 (me) and 14-14-1 (Titus). We are looking forward to the rest of the seasons picks and the forfeits that we will have to do if we lose.
