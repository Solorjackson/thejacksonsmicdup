title: Episode 5
description: Today Titus and I did a ranking for each starting point guard. We compiled a list of the starter from the most recent game for each NBA team. Our lists were made differently (his was statistics based and mine was more talent based). We had some big arguments with some players, One in particular (Damian Lillard). We will continue to make a 1-30 list for each NBA position (SG, SF, PF, & C). Hope you enjoy this new series!
