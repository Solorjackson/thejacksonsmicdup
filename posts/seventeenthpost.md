description: Today Titus and I did our Power Forward rankings for the current NBA. This is just like the Point Guard, Shooting Guard, & Small Forward rankings concept wise. We didn't have as many disagreements as usual because most of the Power Forwards that we disagree on (Jayson Tatum), we did in the Small Forward ranking; however, it was still a lot of fun compiling the list.
