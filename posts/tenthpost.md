title: Episode 10
description: Today Titus and I went over our picks that we made in Episode 6 "NFL Week 10 Preview". We made some bold picks throughout this week and some of them worked out, while some of them really did not work in our favor. Although we had lots of different teams for some of the games, we have the same record at the moment (7-6-1). We will have to see who gets more picks right for Week 11.
