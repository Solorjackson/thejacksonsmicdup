description: Today Titus and I ranked the starting NFL Quarterbacks in order from 1 to 32. We had some big disagreements with players like Kirk Cousins, but for the most part we agreed with the general area of our QBs. We both have some bias with our favorite teams, so Trevor Lawrence is probably a little too high for my list and for Titus, he probably has Jalen Hurts a little to high, but it is definitely better than the last time we made a QB list (off camera he had Hurts as a top 5 QB...)
